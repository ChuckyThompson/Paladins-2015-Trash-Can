You can remember your username for pushing:
  Start -> Git Bash
  cd Paladins-2015-Trash-Can
  git config --get remote.origin.url
  copy the value using:
  - [upper left menu click] -> Edit -> Mark
  - select the web site address
  - press enter (copies)
  - use it to paste at the end of the following command, adding your UID
    before the '@' symbol:
  git config remote.origin.url https://wdross@github.com/killjoy64/Paladins-2015-Trash-Can


All future 'Commit and Push' commands will have your UID filled out,
only needing a password.
